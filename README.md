# House-Price-Prediction

This project is all about  how to build a house price prediction website. We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. The concepts 
used during the model bulding is data load and cleaning , outlier detection and removal , feature engineering , dimentionality reduction , k fold cross validation etc. 

The Tecchnology used for bulding project - 

1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. visual studio code 
6. Python flask for http server
7. HTML/CSS/Javascript for User Interface
